Hey, I'm Sam Bowden. I'm currently a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Leicester.

You'll find the source code of some of the projects that I've worked on in my spare time here.

I use SourceHut now and I'm not developing my personal projects on this GitHub profile anymore. You can find my new SourceHut profile here: 
<https://sr.ht/~sam-bowden/>

Sam-Bowden/Sam-Bowden is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
