Hey, I'm Sam Bowden. I'm currently a 3rd year computer science student at the University of Leicester.

You'll find the source code of some of the projects that I've worked on in my spare time here. I also use [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Sam-Bowden).

<!---
Sam-Bowden/Sam-Bowden is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
