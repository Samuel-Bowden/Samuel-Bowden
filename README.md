Hello, I'm computer science graduate from the University of Leicester. I'm passionate about artificial intelligence, programming language theory, open source software and Linux. For my final year project at university, I developed a browser and interpreter in Rust for a novel scripting language, [Zonkey](https://github.com/Samuel-Bowden/zonkey).
